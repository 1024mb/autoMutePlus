Auto Mute Plus is an idea I have and is work in progress. For now, you're better off getting the original Auto mute FireFox extension below.

I plan to add the following features:
- A toolbar button to enable and disable auto mute.
- A whitelist for sites or pages that will never be auto muted, possibly with RegEx enabled.
- A blacklist for sites or pages that will always be auto muted, even when auto mute is disabled with the toolbar button.

Below is the original README.md from https://github.com/WaldiPL/autoMute
